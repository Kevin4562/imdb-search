# imdb-search
IMDb's advanced search with filter support for specific streaming platforms, additional genres, additional ratings/certifications, and more.

IMDb has an exclusive deal with Amazon Prime so they leave out the option to filter by netflix, hulu, ect. They are also more geared toward Movies rather than TV so they leave out options such as sorting by TV-MA ratings/ceritifications.
